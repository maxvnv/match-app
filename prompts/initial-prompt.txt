I would like to create a tennis match app that would match tennis players in a city for a match. I've notice that in my city (Krak√≥w), recreational tennis players are struggling to find a match, and 
are looking for people in facebook groups, which is inconvenient, and I would like to create a solution for this problem.

The main requirements for MVP for this applications are:
- User is able to register and login using either his credentials (email and password or login using gmail)
- User is able to fill in additional information about him: name, surname, current tennis ntrp level, his home town, age, sex.
- User is able to propose a play for a certain day, time, and optionally tennis court
- User is able to look for proposals made by other users and accept
- Once the match is played, either of the users (proposing or accepting) is able to enter the match details (score)
- Match history is visible for both players

Technical stack for backend should be 
- java 21
- gradle
- spring
- H2 / Postgres
- you are encouraged to propose any other supporting library you think will be suitable

Observability:
- Micrometer
- Prometheus
- Grafana
- OpenSearch (logs)

Deployment:
- Terraform
- AWS
- gitlab (CI/CD)

For iOS and Reach (front end) stack, I would like to ask you to come up with the technical stack yourself, keeping in mind that I am a backend engineer and I know very minimal when
if comes to front end or app development.

I have a sceleton for a project with some code already done. It's in the current project (match-app).

With this in mind, I need you to 
- Analize the existing code
- Come up with detailed business requirements for the project and write them to REQ.md file
- Evaluate the existing code, and the detailed business requirements that you've compiled, and think about a few possible development approaches before landing on the best one.
Provide reasoning on why this would be the best approach. Remember, first I would like to work on the MVP for the backend app until it's developed and deployed to AWS, before starting to work on
the front end and iOS app, but keep in mind about these plans.
- Document this chosen development approach as detailed as possible in a form of checklist (it can be nested, for example: phase 2.3) with optional comments. Checklist is important
because I want to track what's been done and what not. Write this file to PLAN.md
- Remember that this project is an opportunity for me to learn building the project, so the plan should account for that. It shouldn't assume my previous technical knowledge
- Remenber that tests are important, we would like to have unit and integration tests coverage
- Remember that security is important. This subject is my weak point and I would like to focus on it when it comes to secutiry implementation. Same comes to observability and deployment
- Having business requirements and technical development plan, come up with README.md file that would take the highlevel overview of both.
- The files should be well structured and easy to read and navigate, in markdown format

Notice there are already files that describe the business requirements, technical vision and checklist of what's been already done and a plan for future work. These files are BUSINESS_REQUIREMENTS .md and TECHICAL_DOCUMNETATION.md.
There's also README.md that describes high level business requirements for the app and the technical stack.
I don't want you to treat it as a source of truth, but rather as an inspiration. You should only look at these files when you're done with your work, and use the information from there that's missing in your work.
