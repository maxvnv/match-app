I'm working on a tennis match app that would match tennis players in a city for a match. For now I'm working on the backend component, however this backend will be serving front end (react) and mobile ios app, both to be developed, but good to keep in mind. 

I have a sceleton for a project with some code already done. This was mainly done my an ai agent. I'll attach the git ingested file for it. 

Notice there are two readme files that describe the business requirements, technical vision and checklist of what's been already done and a plan for future work. These files are DEVELOPMENT_LOG .md and README.md. 

I'm planning to continue working onit with another ai agent, and I need you to create a detailed plan of actions (a guide) for this ai agent so it can pick up from there and guide me effectively. 

As part of this guide, I need

- analize the existing code
- analize these two *.md files, and combine the content in them, making it a single clear document
- extract the business requirements to a separate .md file
- extract the technical part to a separate .md file
- in the technical file I want to have 1) a high level technical overview of the project 2) a detailed development plan along with checklist 3) under every technical decision I need a consice but meaningful reasoning as to why this decision was made as well as why not alternatives
- keep in mind that this technical file will be serving as my personal reference point as well as a guide for AI agent. You may consider to create a separate file with just instructions for ai agent, up to you. 
- I want ai agent to update the mentioned documentation every time we make a change (e.g. check the checklist, or update the development plan if we deviate from the existing one)
- The files should be well structured and easy to read and navigate, in markdown format

As for the development plan, apart from what has been mentioned already in the files, keep in mind that I want to learn things as we develop the project with the help of AI, I also want the service to have a high level of security, and eventually I want to deploy it to AWS (as early as possible), and deploy it with the help of Terraform. The project should also unitize the observabity tools, like Prometheus & Grafana and Kibana / OpenSearch for logs.

Make the output downlowdable files.
