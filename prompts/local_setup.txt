Let's take a step back. Before we continue I'd like to have near-production-like setup locally. In the end what I'd like to have is: run one command that would spin up the app, prometheus, grafana and elastic search (or similar to view logs, maybe grafana supports it, you should evaluate on that). Once everything is up and running, I'd like to be able to send requests to the app and 1) see logs, 2) see metrics for the app. 
My assumption is that the best way to achive it is with docker, and additional configuration. 
Your task is to evaluate my requirements and come up with the plan to achieve it. Re-iterate multiple times testing your assumption, reason and choose the best way to go, according to my requirements and best development practices. This plan shouldn't be very high level, it should also account for details. Remember that I'm learning things. Once done, you should also write the plan to a file LOCAL_SETUP.md.
